# Final Year Research Project Similarity Score Demo

# SimilarityDemo

This demo showcases how to compute semantic similarity between disaster-related news messages and an ontology using Sentence-BERT and a Flask web app.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zuhrahmohammed/SimilarityDemo.git
cd SimilarityDemo
```

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask App

```bash
flask run
```

The app will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

---

## How It Works

The app loads ontology descriptions from `ontology_descriptions.json` and uses Sentence-BERT to compute a similarity score between a user-input message and known disaster-related concepts.
